Trigger Word Detection
==================

(The modeling file and the datasets are ignored.)


The files named like `mycode_532` are for the first section (about creating the dataset).

In the first section of this assignment, I cannot get the same outputs as the offically offered results. 


The files named like `mycode_532_2` are for the second section (about the model).


The files named like `mycode_532_3` are for the section 2.3 (about testing the model and making predictions). 

Here, `my_voice.wav` is an exmaple for testing, which is recorded by me. And this pre-trained model works fine with my voice.
